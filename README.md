# Fill Labs Tasks

Developed to successfully complete tasks provided by Fill Labs during the job application process, this project aims to showcase the skills and capabilities of candidates. Below are details regarding the solutions to the given questions and the "User Management Project," a comprehensive project incorporating these solutions.

## Solutions to Questions

1. **Question 1: Word Sorting**
   - Problem: Sort a given list of words based on the number of "a" characters within each word in descending order. If some words have the same number of "a" characters, sort them by their lengths.
   - Developed Function: [Solution 1](#question-1)

2. **Question 2: Recursive Function**
   - Problem: Write a recursive function that takes an integer parameter and produces output based on a specific algorithm.
   - Developed Function: [Solution 2](#question-2)

3. **Question 3: Most Repeated Data**
   - Problem: Write a function that takes an array/list as a parameter and finds the most repeated data within the given array.
   - Developed Function: [Solution 3](#question-3)

4. **User Management Project**

 - For detailed information and instructions, please refer to the [User Management Project README.md](https://github.com/kkg52/Fill-Labs-Tasks/blob/main/Q4/README.md) file.

This project has been created to assess candidates' problem-solving skills during the job application process. Candidates can demonstrate their abilities by presenting solutions to the provided questions and exploring the User Management Project.

## Question 1

### Problem Statement

Write a function that sorts a list of words based on the number of characters "a" within each word in decreasing order. If some words contain the same number of "a" characters, then sort those words by their lengths.

#### Input
```go
["aaaasd", "a", "aab", "aaabcd", "ef", "cssssssd", "fdz", "kf", "zc", "lklklklklklklklkl", "l"]
```

#### Output
```go
["aaaasd", "aaabcd", "aab", "a", "lklklklklklklklkl", "cssssssd", "fdz", "ef", "kf", "zc", "l"]
```

## Question 2

### Problem Statement

Write a recursive function that takes an integer parameter. The function should generate the following output based on the provided algorithm.

#### Input
```go
9
```

#### Output
```go
2
4
9
```

## Question 3

### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes an array/list as a parameter and finds the most repeated data within the given array.

#### Test Input
```go
["apple", "pie", "apple", "red", "red", "red"]
```

#### Output
```go
"red"
```
